              Blogging is far from dead. As the last two years of
              X-formerly-Twitter drama has shown, allowing a social media
              platform to control your access to your audience has risks.If you
              want a platform where you can share your thoughts properly and
              keep control of things, it's impossible to beat a blog. Plus, you
              can always share your blog posts on social media.

                Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources
                and recommendations to customers, the best way to do it is often
                to add a blog to your website. Best of all, your blog content
                gets indexed by Google— unlike almost all social media posts— so
                you can drive potential customers to your business through
                content marketing (and without having to pay for ads).Look at
                the blog you're reading right now: Zapier blog posts get
                millions of views per month and are one of the most valuable
                ways of getting new customers at Zapier.
